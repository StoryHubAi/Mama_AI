MAMA-AI SMS Testing Guide
========================

Your SMS service is now fully configured and working! Here's how to test it:

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Status:
âœ… SMS Service: WORKING
âœ… AI Integration: ENABLED (GitHub AI - Llama model)
âœ… Shortcode: 15629
âœ… Environment: Sandbox
âœ… All messages routed to AI (no hardcoded responses)

## ðŸ“± How SMS Works:

### When someone sends SMS to shortcode 15629:

1. **First-time user (START/Hello/Any message):**
   - AI welcomes them to MAMA-AI
   - Explains the service
   - User gets added to database

2. **Health questions:**
   - "I'm pregnant and feeling sick"
   - "What foods are good during pregnancy?"  
   - "My baby is crying a lot, what should I do?"
   - All answered by AI with personalized, helpful responses

3. **Help requests:**
   - "HELP" or "MENU"
   - AI explains how to use the service

4. **Unsubscribe:**
   - "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE"
   - AI provides polite goodbye message
   - User marked as inactive in database

## ðŸ§ª Testing Methods:

### Method 1: Africa's Talking Simulator
1. Go to: https://simulator.africastalking.com/
2. Login with your credentials
3. Send SMS to shortcode 15629
4. Test various messages:
   - "START"
   - "I'm 25 weeks pregnant and have questions"
   - "What should I eat during pregnancy?"
   - "HELP"
   - "STOP"

### Method 2: Real Phone (if you have credits)
1. Send SMS from any Kenyan mobile number
2. Send to shortcode 15629
3. Type any health question or "START"

### Method 3: API Testing

POST to: http://your-app-url/test-sms
Body: {
    "phone_number": "+254712345678",
    "message": "Test message from AI"
}

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results:

âœ… **Every message gets AI response** - no hardcoded replies

âœ… **SMS-friendly length** - mostly under 160 characters
âœ… **Personalized** - AI considers user history and preferences
