## 🚀 Next Steps for Africa's Talking Setup

### Step 1: Get Voice Number
1. Login to your [Africa's Talking Dashboard](https://account.africastalking.com)
2. Go to **Voice** > **Phone Numbers**
3. Purchase a voice-enabled phone number
4. Note down your voice number

### Step 2: Configure Voice Settings
1. In the dashboard, go to **Voice** > **Settings**
2. Set **Voice Callback URL** to: `https://yourdomain.com/voice`
3. Enable **DTMF** (touch-tone) support
4. Set **Voice Type** to "woman" (or your preference)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Voice Settings (update these with your actual values)
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
VOICE_PHONE_NUMBER=+254700000000  # Your actual AT voice number
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production
For testing with real calls, you need a public URL:

**Option A: Using ngrok (for testing)**
```bash
# Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
ngrok http 5000
# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Update Africa's Talking callback to: https://abc123.ngrok.io/voice
```

**Option B: Deploy to cloud (for production)**
- Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or any cloud service
- Update callback URL to your production domain

## 📞 How It Works

### 1. User Calls Your Number
```
User dials → Africa's Talking → Your /voice endpoint
```

### 2. Voice Flow
